	// public means that the method is visible and can be called from other objects of other types.
	//Static means that the method is associated with the class, not a specific instance, i.e. object of that class
	//Void means that the method has no return value. If the method returned int for example, you would write int instead of void and main is the main method name.
    //So this is the name of the method that Java looks for as the initiation or start in point three executes a Java program.
	//So string args is a parameter and this is often to provide arguments as a string when executes in a Java program via command line.
